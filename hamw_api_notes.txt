hamweather api notes

endpoints are for requests - you request an endpoint, they are the types of data you can request
it looks like requests are per endpoint - so, if you ask for temp, feelslike, and weather (under observations), it counts as one hit. actually, 
is that right? cuz i did one with 5 from 'ob' and one from 'place'
place names with separate words use format new+york, kansas+city, san+francisco
